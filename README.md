### Examples how you can serve machine learning models as cloud function

Right now we have 6 examples:

-----------------------------
- diabetes prediction (structured data), implemented with scikit-learn, running on Python 3.6 at Microsoft Azure Functions
- diabetes prediction (structured data), implemented with scikit-learn, running on Python 3.6 at Google Cloud Functions
- german tweets categorization (sentiment analysis), implemented with SpaCy, running on Python 3.6 at Google Cloud Functions
- flower images categorization, implemented with Tensorflow, running on Python 2.7 at AWS Lambda
- flower images categorization, implemented with Tensorflow, running on Node 8 at Google Cloud Functions
- flower images categorization, implemented with Tensorflow, running on Node 8 at AWS Lambda (currently works in offline mode only)

Feel free to contribute!

Documentation is rather poor right now, we will improve it latest 15 March 2019
